  <h1>Kanye Quotes</h1>
</center>

<p>"I think I do myself a disservice by comparing myself to Steve Jobs and Walt Disney and human beings that we've seen before. It should be more like Willy Wonka... and welcome to my chocolate factory." ~Kanye</p>
<p>"Would you believe in what you believe in if you were the only one who believed it?" ~Kanye</p>
<p>"I feel like I'm too busy writing history to read it." ~Kanye</p>
<p>"I am Warhol. I am the No. 1 most impactful artist of our generation. I am Shakespeare in the flesh." ~Kanye</p>
<p>"I would never want a book's autograph. I am a proud non-reader of books." ~Kanye</p>
<p>"“I hate when I'm on a flight and I wake up with a water bottle next to me like oh great now I gotta be responsible for this water bottle.” ~Kanye</p>
